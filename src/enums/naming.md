# Naming

You are expected to name enums the same as you would regular classes: `WithCapitals`.

The variants of enums are expected to be named in all capital letters, with underscores[^scream]

```java
enum CarSeat {
    DRIVER,
    SHOTGUN,
    BACK_LEFT,
    BACK_RIGHT
}
```

[^scream]: We call this convention "`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`", which is silly. Snakes can't speak, let alone scream. I should know.
