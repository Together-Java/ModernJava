# Command Line Arguments

<img src="/command_line_arguments/header.png" height="200px"/>

When you run a program like so

```
java src/Main.java
```

Anything you put to the right of `src/Main.java` will be available to your program as a
"command line argument."[^name]

```
java src/Main.java example
```

[^name]: They come from the command line and they are arguments to your program.
