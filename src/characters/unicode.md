# Unicode

Most letters and symbols that are common in the English speaking world fit into
a single `char`, so pretending that a `char` is always "a single
letter or symbol" is generally a good enough mental model.

Where this falls apart is with things like emoji (👨‍🍳) which are generally considered to be one symbol, but
cannot be represented in a single `char`.

```java,no_run
char chef = '👨‍🍳';
```

`char`s are actually "utf-16 code units". Many symbols require multiple "code units" to represent.

For a full explanation, refer to this old Computerphile video.

It describes "utf-8", which is 8 bits per "code unit." Java's `char`
uses 16 bits, but that is the only difference.
