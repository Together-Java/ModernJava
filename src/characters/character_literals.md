# Character Literals

In order to write a character in a program, you write that one character surrounded
by single quotes.

```java
'a'
```

This is called a "character literal." It has the same relationship to `char` that an integer literal like 123 has to `int`.

```java
// Same as this "integer literal" is used to write a number
int sesameStreet = 123;
// A "character literal" is used to write text
char thisEpisodeIsBroughtToYouBy = 'c';
```
