# Emergent Properties

Emergent properties are things that simply "emerge"
as a consequence of other factors.

Hyrum's law is one of those sorts of things. Nobody sat down and agreed
that they will use an API in wacky ways. It just happens when you throw enough
monkeys in a pile and they all reach for a keyboard.

As such, the way to deal with it isn't to put blame upon the monkeys. Its
to accept it as a naturally occurring phenominon and plan accordingly.
