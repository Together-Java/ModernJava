# Arrays

Arrays are used to represent a fixed-size collection of things.

```java,no_run
int[] oddNumbers = { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 };
```

Fixed-size means that once an array is made, it will always hold the same
number of things.

We call the things stored in an array its "elements."

You can make an array of any type of element by using the name of the type followed by
`[]`.

```java,no_run
char[] letters = { 'a', 'b', 'c' };
String[] words = { "its", "as", "easy", "as" }
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3 };
double[] doubles = { 97.0, 98.0, 99.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 };
```
