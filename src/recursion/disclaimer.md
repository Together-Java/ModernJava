Recursion will be annoying to learn.

Sorry.

It's not because it's particuarly hard or because it's
beyond your ken. It's just that when you learn loops first, recursion
tends to be harder to learn than if you started with it.

The good news is that once you get it, after however much
mental anguish, you won't forget it. And it will be useful, however occasional.
