Recursion will be annoying to learn.

Sorry.

Its not because its particuarly hard or because its
beyond your ken. Its just that when you learn loops first, recursion
tends to be harder to learn than if you started with it.

The good news is that once you get it, after however much
mental anguish, you won't forget it. And it will be useful, however occasionally.
