# Collections

Arrays, `ArrayList`, and `HashMap` are all "collections"
of objects. Importantly, they also aren't the only possible
kinds of collections.

Java provides support for a wide range of different collection types
through "The Collections Framework."[^marketing]

[^marketing]: There is nothing really special about these interfaces and classes that mean they deserve such a name. I view it as a marketing term. There was a period of time before which Java did not have `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, etc. and when they were added they said "this is the new collections framework"
instead of "we've added these dozen classes."
