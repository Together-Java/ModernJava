Remember the rules for this are

* Try to use only the information given up to this point in this book.
* Try not to give up until you've given it a solid attempt

You are extremely likely to be quizzed on `for` loops on any standardized tests,
so these challenges are going to include a lot of repetition and sometimes a tricky
case to handle. Its for your own good, I hope.

## Challenge 1

Write code that will output every number from 0 to 15, including 0 and 15.

```

9
10

15
```

Do it using a `for` loop and again using a `while` loop.

## Challenge 2
