- Try not to give up until you've given it a solid attempt

You are extremely likely to be quizzed on `for` loops on any standardized tests,
so these challenges are going to include a lot of repetition and sometimes a tricky
case to handle. Its for your own good, I hope.

## Challenge 1

Write code that will output every number from 0 to 15, including 0 and 15.

```text

```

Do it using a `for` loop and again using a `while` loop.

## Challenge 2

Do it using a `for` loop and again using a `while` loop.

## Challenge 4

Write code that will output every third number from 51 to 66.

```text
53
56
59
62
65
```

Do it using a `for` loop and again using a `while` loop.

## Challenge 5

Draw a square.

Make it so that you can make the square bigger or smaller by
changing a variable at the start of the program.

```text
*****
*****
*****
*****
```

## Challenge 6

Draw a rectangle.

Make it so that you can make the rectangle bigger or smaller in either dimension by
changing a variable at the start of the program.

```text
******
******
******
```

## Challenge 7

Draw a circle!

Make it so that you can make the circle bigger or smaller by
changing a variable at the start of the program.

```text
    **
   ****
  ******
 ********
  ******
   ****
    **
```

## Challenge 8

Draw a smiley face!

Make it so that you can make the smile bigger or smaller by
changing a variable at the start of the program.
