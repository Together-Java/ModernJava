# Declaration

Declaring a multi-dimensional array is similar to declaring a normal array.

The difference is that instead of only one `[]` following the type declaration, you add an extra `[]`
for each extra dimension.

```java,no_run
// 2d array
int[][] grid;
// 3d array
int[][][] cube;
// 4d array
int[][][][] hypercube;
// ... and so on
```
