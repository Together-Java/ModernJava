# Integer comparisons.
If you don't know the conditions in java, we'd suggest you to check out [this](./if_else/if_statement.md)

Here's an example of an integer comparison between a number and another.
**Example:**
```java
int number = 60
int anotherNumber = 400
if (number < anotherNumber) { // true
    System.out.println("400 > 60");
} else { // not running because it's impossible for 60 to be greater than 400
    System.out.println("60 > 400");
}
```
