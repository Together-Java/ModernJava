# If statements


If statements are useful in many cases you want to check something.

Available logical conditions:
- `a > b` - greater than
- `a < b` - less than
- `a == b` - equal to
- `a != b` - NOT equal to
- `a <= b` - less than or equal to
- `a >= b` - greater than or equal to

For example, We're using `>`:
```java
boolean numberGreaterThanNumber = 20 > 15; // boolean expression
if (numberGreaterThanNumber) { // true
    System.out.println("20 is greater than 15.");
}
```
