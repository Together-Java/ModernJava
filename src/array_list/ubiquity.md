# Ubiquity

Java comes with many classes. Some of these
you might use a few times (like `LocalTime`), some you 
will see every day of your coding life (like `String`).

`ArrayList` is in the second category. It turns out
that a growable list of things is needed for a lot
of different tasks. It is ubiquitous in code that
you will see in the real world.

I mention this mostly to make sure you are paying attention.
Its not particuarly hard, but try not to zone out on these sorts
of chapters.
