/// This class serves as a place to put examples
/// of the different kinds of documentation as well
/// as how to write documentation properly.
///
/// When specified after the three slashes
/// you can write documentation using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
///
/// In Markdown you can just write text as you would in any file,
/// line after line.
///
/// # For headings you can use a single hash
///
/// ## For subheadings you can use two
///
/// ### And so on
///
/// You can make unordered lists using hyphens
///
/// - A
/// - B
/// - C
///
/// And numbered lists like so
///
/// 1. One
/// 2. Two
/// 3. Thre
///
/// And so on. Definitely peruse up [tutorial on markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
/// when you have the time.
///
/// There are some additions specific to Java though.
/// We call these additions "tags."
///
/// One notable tag is the author tag. It lets you mark who worked
/// on a given unit of code
///
/// @author Ethan McCue
/// @see [https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html)
