# Challenges

Remember the rules for this are

- Try to use only the information given up to this point in this book.
- Try not to give up until you've given it a solid attempt

## Challenge 1.

Run `javadoc` on some of your code. Add the command for doing so to a `Justfile`.
Make sure to include cleaning stale of output.

## Challenge 2.

When you ran `javadoc` on your code you were almost certainly hit by a deluge of `warning: no comment`
messages.

Fix these by documenting that code enough that `javadoc` no longer gives you warnings.

## Challenge 3.

Read the [documentation for java.util.StringJoiner](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/docs/api/java.base/java/util/StringJoiner.html).

If you can, alter one of your projects to use it.
