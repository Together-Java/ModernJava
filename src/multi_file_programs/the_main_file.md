# The Main file

Inside your `src` folder make a file called `Main.java`. This is the file where
we are going to write the "start" of the program.

All the Java code you've written up until now will work if you put it into this file.

```java
void main() {
    IO.println("Hello, world!");
}
```

So you should now have something that looks like this.

```
project/
  src/
    Main.java
```

To run your program, use the `java` command.

```
$ java src/Main.java
Hello, world!
```
