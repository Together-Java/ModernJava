# The Sources folder

When people work on "a project" - meaning a program made to
accomplish some task - there will often be more than just Java code involved.

To deal with this its common to make a folder to put Java code into. I prefer the name
`src` for this.

```
$ mkdir src
```

And inside this `src` folder we will put the code.[^layouts]

So you should have this

```
project/ <- Open this in your text editor
  src/ <- Code will go here
```

[^layouts]: There are different ways to layout a project. All are valid. You can call the `src` folder `STUFF` - it ultimately doesn't matter. This is just another one of those social conventions.
