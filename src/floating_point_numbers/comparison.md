# Comparison

In addition to comparing for equality with `==` and `!=`, `doubles`s can be compared to see if one is bigger than another using
`>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`.

This works the same as it does with `int`s.

```java
~void main() {
double x = 1.5;
double y = 0.2;

// true
System.out.println(x > y);
// false
System.out.println(x < y);
~}
```
