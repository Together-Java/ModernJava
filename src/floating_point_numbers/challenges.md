# Challenges

Remember the rules for this are

* Try to use only the information given up to this point in this book.
* Try not to give up until you've given it a solid attempt

## Challenge 1

What will this program output when run? Write down your guess and then try running it.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double x = 5.1;
        double y = 2.4;
        System.out.println(x + y);
    }
}
```

## Challenge 2

What will this program output when run? Write down your guess and then try running it.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double x = 5.1;
        double y = 2.1;
        System.out.println(x + y);
    }
}
```

## Challenge 3

What will this program output when run? Write down your guess and then try running it.

How can you make it give the "right" answer?

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double x = 5 / 2;
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}
```

## Challenge 4

These two expressions give different results. Why is that, and what results do they give?

```java
double resultOne = (int) 5.0 / 2 + 5.0 / 2;
double resultTwo = (int) (5.0 / 2 + 5.0 / 2);

System.out.println(resultOne);
System.out.println(resultTwo);
```

## Challenge 5

The following is a quadratic equation.

\\[ 2x^2 + 8x + 3 = 0 \\]

To find the solutions of any quadratic equation you can use the following formula.

\\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} }{2a} \\]

Where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the prefixes of each term in the following equation.

\\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\]

Write some code that finds both solutions to any quadratic equation defined by some variables
`a`, `b`, and `c`. If the equation has imaginary solutions, you are allowed to just output `NaN`.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // For this one in particular, you should output
        // -3.5811388300842 and -0.41886116991581
        // but your code should work with these three numbers changed to
        // represent any given quadratic equation.
        double a = 2;
        double b = 8;
        double c = 3;

        double resultOne = ???;
        double resultTwo = ???;

        System.out.println(resultOne);
        System.out.println(resultTwo);
    }
}
```
