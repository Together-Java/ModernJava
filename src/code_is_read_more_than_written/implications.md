# Implications

This means that, sometimes, it makes sense to write code in a way that
is "harder" than is absolutely needed.

That's a bit of a fuzzy statement, but on the more obvious side it means
doing things like spending extra time on code formatting, variable naming,
function contracts, writing comments, etc.

All of those things make it easier to read that code later on.
