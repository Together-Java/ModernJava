# Information Density

An important related concept is information density.

Yes, you can do things like add a comment on every line of code.
This does mean that a later reader will have context on exactly what
you were thinking as you were writing the code.[^literate]

The downside is that there can be way more "extra" information than any
educated person needs to understand the code. That extra information takes up space
and spreads out the "important" information.

Put another way, if something has a high information density it can be hard to read.

> M.M.A.T.B.C

Same as if it is has too low an information density.

> Dearest sir, it would behoove you to meetest mineself posthaste after the school hours. I would perchance suggest that the location be betwixt the basketball courts.

You want an information density that is "just right"

> Meet me at the basketball court
