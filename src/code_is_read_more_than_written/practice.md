# Practice

If you want to do programming as your job or as part of your job,
and you want to be competent, it isn't enough to just practice writing code.
You also need to practice reading.

There are a lot of ways to go about that, but an easy one is to
read the code of your classmates or of strangers on the internet.

Read their code, try to understand all the (maybe wacky!) choices they made
while writing it, and try to change it up a little bit.

This will help you get an intuitive sense for what you like in
a codebase as well as what you do not. It will also, more so than
the early struggles you go through when learning to write, help you
understand if you would actually like to do this for work.
