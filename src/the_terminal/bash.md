# Bash

If you are programming on a computer running either Mac or Linux you should have easy access
to a bash terminal. Just search your applications for something called "terminal" or that has the word "term" in it.

This is the most common kind of terminal for working professionals to use.[^asterisk]

[^asterisk]: Asterisks apply, of course. I didn't run or try to find a survey so this is mostly anecdotal.
