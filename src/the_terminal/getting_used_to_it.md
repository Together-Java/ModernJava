# Getting Used to it

So far this is only a shallow dive. It will take a good amount of time for you to get
comfortable using the terminal for things.

Thats normal. You'll get there eventually. Just know that at least some familiarity with the terminal is going to be needed.

We'll get back to it relatively soon, but feel free to seek out some bash/terminal specific resources online in the meantime.
