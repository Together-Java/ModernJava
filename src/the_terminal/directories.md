# Directories

Directories, also known as folders, are the places where files are in a computer.

When you open a terminal, you are "inside" a particular directory.

You can see the directory you are in by running the `pwd`[^pwd] command.

```bash
$ pwd
/Users/emccue
```


[^pwd]: "Print Working Directory"
