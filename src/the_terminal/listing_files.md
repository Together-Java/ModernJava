# Listing Files

You can list the files in your current working directory with the `ls`[^ls] command.

```bash
$ ls
Applications
Camera
Desktop
Development
Documents
Downloads
```

This is useful for getting your bearings, but also to find a file you forget the name of or similar.


[^ls]: Short for "List"
