# Creating Files

To create a blank file you can use the `touch`[^why] command.

```bash
$ touch hello.txt
```

This is situationally useful, but more often than not you will create files
using a program called a "text editor."

There are some text editors, like [`vim`](https://www.vim.org/), which run entirely
inside the terminal.[^diehard]

At the start of this book I showed you [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/). If you weren't otherwise shown a different option, that is a decent default. You can use it to create and edit files.

[^why]: This is called `touch` because it will "touch" a file and update its "last updated timestamp" but change nothing else.

[^diehard]: These have their die hard supporters. The lunatics.

[^thisbook]: This book has been written inside Visual Studio Code.
