# Creating Files

To create a blank file you can use the `touch`[^no_clue] command.

```bash
$ touch hello.txt
```

This is situationally useful, but more often than not you will create files
using a program called a "text editor."

There are some text editors, like [`vim`](https://www.vim.org/), which run entirely
inside the terminal.[^diehard]

One of the more popular ones at time of writing is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you weren't otherwise shown a different option, that is a decent default. Install it and then you can use it to create and edit files.

[^no_clue]: I have no clue why this is called `touch`.
[^diehard]: These have their die hard supporters. The lunatics.
[^thisbook]: This book has been written inside Visual Studio Code.
