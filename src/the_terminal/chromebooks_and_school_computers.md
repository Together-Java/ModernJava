# Chromebooks and School Computers

A very common thing that school systems will do is prevent students from accessing a terminal.

This is a good thing if your goal is to prevent high schoolers from committing shenanigans. Less so if your goal is to learn how to program.

There are also computer types, like chromebooks, which aren't really built with programming in mind. While you could access a terminal, the sorts of programs you would generally install to
work with Java will be out of reach. It's a similar case for things like iPads.

If you are in one of these situations I would recommend getting a "normal" computer if at all possible. You can make do for a time, but eventually it will be required to continue in this field.[^thems]
