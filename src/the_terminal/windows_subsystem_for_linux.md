# Windows Subsystem for Linux

If you are using Windows there are two terminals that come preinstalled. One is `cmd.exe`, where
you write in a language called batch, and the other is "PowerShell."

Both of these differ in significant ways from bash so, if at all possible, you should get set up with the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

This will let you follow along with the bash snippets you'll see later in this book.[^other_shells]

[^other_shells]: It is certainly possible for me to also include instruction for PowerShell and batch but it doesn't feel practical. I spend most of my working hours using batch and can test commands on the machine I use to write this. It would be hard for me to do that with the Windows specific shells
