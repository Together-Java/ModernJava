# Commands

The primary way you interact with a terminal is by running commands.

You start with a blank prompt and write something like the following[^nottyped].

```bash
$ echo Hello
Hello
```

The first word is the name of the program to run. In this case `echo`. Everything after
that is an "argument" to the program.

[^nottyped] You don't actually type the `$`. That is illustrative. Your terminal will give you something like a `$` or a `>` as a "prompt."
