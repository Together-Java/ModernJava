# Documentation

When sharing code that is intended to be used as a library it is important to explain
how exactly your code should be used.

If you can physically or digitally converse with the people you are sharing with this is a solved problem.
They can ask you questions and you can answer them. Rinse and repeat until they no longer need to ask you
questions.

But seeing as there are millions of developers in the world that isn't always practical.[^grouptext]

One tool we use to combat this reality is documentation. Documentation is where we write down what things are, what they do and why.

[^grouptext]: Would make for one hell of a hectic group text.
