# Interpreting Input

When you call `IO.readln` the human on the other side can type whatever they want.

This means that, depending on the question you asked, you might need to interpret
what they typed as something other than a `String`.

The way to do this differs depending on what type you want, but for at least the types we covered so far
there is a basic-enough process.
