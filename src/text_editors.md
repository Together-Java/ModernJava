# Text Editors

Code is written in "text files." These are files that just contain 
text.

This is different from something like Microsoft Word or the notes app on a phone.
Those kinds of programs are for "rich text." Meaning you can bold words, change font
colors, embed images - all sorts of stuff.

Text files only store text.

To create and edit text files we use programs called "text editors."
