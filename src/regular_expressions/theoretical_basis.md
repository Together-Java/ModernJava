# Theoretical Basis

There are basically two levels you can engage the concept of regular expressions
at.

The first is as a practical tool for matching patterns in text. You will learn
how to construct special strings that act as a shorthand for code that can
recognize if text meets a certain shape.

The second is around their place in the theory of computation. A regular expression
is one step above a "deterministic finite automata" and one step below a "turing machine."

I tend to find that diving into the theoretical makes the practical part a lot less intimidating.
It will be a giant tangent, but i suggest [diving in to a theory of computation course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJhfQp1jgGI&list=PLRgsEjJNLnh7yx0AAQMrdJssDySazeJzZ)[^random]. When you come out
of it regular expressions will be much easier to understand.

[^random]: I just searched online and this one popped up. It looks fine, but maybe its not or maybe there is something better.
