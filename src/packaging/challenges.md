Remember the rules for this are

- Try to use only the information given up to this point in this book.
- Try not to give up until you've given it a solid attempt

## Challenge 1.

Package up the code from the previous section's challenges into JAR files.

Run those JAR files using `--module-path ...` and `--module`.

## Challenge 2.

Inspect the contents of the JARs you just created with `jar --list <file>`
and `jar --describe-module <file>`.

Ensure that the module names you picked match up with the file names for the jars.


## Challenge 3.

Use `--main-class` to specify the main classes for the previous modules.

You can make sure you did it right by trying to run them directly.
