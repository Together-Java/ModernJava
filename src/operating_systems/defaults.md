# Defaults

A social aspect of operating systems is that they control the "default"
experience people have with computers.

Installing an operating system is prohibitvely difficult, so computer manufacturers
install one before selling a device. When they choose Windows and Windows comes
with Internet Explorer built in, people use Internet Explorer.[^lawsuit]

There are a lot of kinda grim things that follow from this, and you should dig deeper,
but I bring it up to mention the 1980s.

The personal computers available then, like the [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64),
only had text based interfaces. In many practical ways, people were closer to the world of programming.[^movies] 

So think about that whenever you feel like you have a lot left to learn. A lot of what you do and do not know
about computers was dictated for you by the fact that you grew up interacting with them on a touch screen
instead of on a terminal. Things are not as intimiating as they seem.
