# Game Consoles

Game Consoles generally always do their own wacky thing.

For the same reasons as mobile devices, you will have a lot of trouble
trying to program on a game console. They are special made to run Halo.[^age]

[^age]: Yeah, Halo sucks now. Halo 3 was art. Obtuse, beautiful, orchestral art. I am old enough to have lived
in the age of dreams and to know of their dimming.
