# Prelude

First of all, thank you for your time and for your patience.

I know that when I was in school I never wanted to read a book
and, except for [The Cay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cay) and [Great Expectations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Expectations), I
got away without having to.

So while it is hypocritical for me to ask this of you,
this book is written to be read linearly like a book. You can skip the rest
of this prelude if you aren't interested and just dive in once you've got your [machine set up to code](./getting_started/hello_world.md), but keep that in mind.

This book is written specifically for those folks that feel like giving up, like they are too stupid to get it,
or like they didn't understand a damn thing their professor has said for the last three months.

I see you. You are not stupid. This is not your fault, it is theirs.[^probably]

[^probably]: probably.
