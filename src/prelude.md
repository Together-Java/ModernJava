# Prelude

First of all, thank you for your time and for your patience.

I know that when I was in school I never wanted to read a book
and, except for [The Cay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cay) and [Great Expectations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Expectations), I
got away without having to.

So while it is hypocritical for me to ask this of you,
please read this book like a book and go from the start to the end, one section at a time.

At the end of each section
there will also be challenges. I want you to at least attempt all of them before moving on to the next section.

This book is written specifically for those folks that feel like giving up, like they are too stupid to get it,
or like they didn't understand a damn thing their professor has said for the last three months.

I see you. You are not stupid. This is not your fault.[^probably]

[^probably]: probably.
