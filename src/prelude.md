# Prelude

First of all, thank you for your time and for your patience.

I know that when I was in school I never wanted to read a book
and, except for [The Cay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cay) and [Great Expectations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Expectations), I
got away without having to.

So while it is hypocritical for me to ask this of you,
please read this book like a book and go from the start to the end, one section at a time.

This book has been written with the specific intention of helping those who may be struggling with [Modern Java programming](https://www.protechtraining.com/blog/post/modern-java-for-the-modern-age-by-nick-maiorano-937). It is intended to be accessible and **easy** to understand, even if you've had trouble in the past with similar experience. Whether you're a student who's feeling lost in a class, an old-school buddy who's trying to catch up with the latest updates, or a professional who needs to brush up on the basics, this book is for you ðŸ«µ.

At the end of each section, you will find challenges that are designed to help reinforce your understanding of the concepts you saw. We recommend you to attempt these challenges before moving to next section(s).

We wish you the best of luck, and we think you're strong enough to get better as you go.
