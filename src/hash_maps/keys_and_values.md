# Keys and Values

A Hash Map "maps" keys to values. 

In the filing cabinet analogy we are mapping names to charts
full of all sorts of other information on the person.

For the rest of these examples assume we are trying to map
`CarsCharacter`s to how many times they won the Piston Cup.[^watchcars]

[^watchcars]: Cars was a delightful movie. Go to your local second hand store, get
a copy on DVD, and make a night of it.
