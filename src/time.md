# Time

Wikipedia defines "time" as "The continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, and into the future."[^source]

Most everything that interacts with the real world needs to understand information about time.
As such, Java has various ways to work with data that holds information about time.
