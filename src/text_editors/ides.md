# IDEs

A term you might have heard or will hear in the future is "IDE."

IDE stands for "Integrated Development Environment." It is basically a text editor
with a bunch of features "integrated" that ease "development" of software.

Programs like [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/), [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), and [Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/index.html)
are all considered Java IDEs. This is because they come integrated with
functionality that makes developing specficially programs in Java easier.

Text editors that have plugins available can often be juiced up enough that they will also
be considered "IDEs." This is the case for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
which has two Java plugins as well as plugins which support development in other languages.[^matter]

[^matter]: Now does any of this matter right now? No. I just think its good to not get confused
or get unneeded FOMO.
