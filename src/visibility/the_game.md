# The Game

The only reason you would care about how visible a particular method or field is
if you were playing what I call "the game[^that]"

In the game you take some unit of code, like a class, and pretend that someone is going to
try and do every possible thing that you can do with it.

If you have methods named `stepOne()`, `stepTwo()` and `stepThree()` - what happens if someone calls them in the wrong order. If you have a field named `denominator` - what happens if someone sets it to zero. That sort of thing.

[^that]: Not the game that you just lost by remembering you were playing the game.
