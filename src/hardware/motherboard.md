# Motherboard

All of these parts, and the parts I didn't mention, are connected to
a big circuit board called a "motherboard."

The motherboard connects the CPU, RAM, and any hard drive(s) such that they
can "talk" to eachother. The details of how it does this aren't super important, so just imagine
that a tiny wizard lives inside it.
