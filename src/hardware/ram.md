# RAM

CPUs can do math real fast, but they can't remember much stuff.[^likeme]

This is what RAM is for. RAM stands for "random access memory." The random access
part just means that a CPU can ask for any bit of info at any time.

Most computers nowadays have an even number of RAM sticks. This is for interesting reasons I
don't fully understand.

[^likeme]: In 8th grade I had someone physically hand me a piece of paper with their name and
fun facts about them because I had kept forgetting their name the entire year. I don't know what
Sam is up to now, but I remember that she likes pistachio ice cream.
