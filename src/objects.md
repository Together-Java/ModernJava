# Object

You may have heard the phrase "everything is an object" 
parroted about.

It sounds very silly. Of course things are things, what else would they be?

In Java it has a very specific meaning. There is a class named
`java.lang.Object` (`Object` for short) which all other classes are
derived from.

Everything "is" an `Object`.
