# Interfaces

Generics let you write code that doesn't care
what is different between different things - you would accept a `String`
or an `Integer`, doesn't matter what is diferent between them.

Interfaces do a related thing. They let you write code that takes advantage
of commonalities.

```java
interface Dog {
    void bark();
}
```
