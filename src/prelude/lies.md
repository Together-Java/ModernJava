# Lies

At various points in this book I am also going to lie to you. Specifically I will
make lies of omission.

If there are five ways to do something, I might pretend that there is only one
way to do it until I give you enough context so that I can talk about the other
four.

This can be particuarly annoying if you are in a course that is teaching things
in a different order or if you feel rushed to just get some project done.

I get that. I just ask that you trust me and go in the sequence I am laying out.
I am honestly trying to make it so that you end with a stronger understanding than
you would have otherwise.

If I fail, there is the question mark in the top right of every page.
