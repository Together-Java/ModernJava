# Toy Problems

As you go through this book there will be a lot of what can be considered "toy problems."

That is, you will be shown or asked to write programs that have no obvious real world use.
They will be similar in spirit to math problems like "if you have 8 apples and I take 3, how many apples do you have left?"

The intent is not for these to be annoying, although I am sure they will be. I just don't know any other way to build an understanding
of mechanics.
