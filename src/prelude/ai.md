# AI

Do not use any form of AI when you are learning.

I could go into exactly why or shadowbox against why you might think its a good idea,
but instead I am just going to ask that you trust me.

Don't do it.

If you find it hard to resist the temptation, install something like [this](https://getcoldturkey.com/)
on your machine to block yourself from accessing AI websites.

When you get stuck reach out to a person for help.
