# Java

The bulk of this book will be, as the title suggests,
covering the Java programming language.

To clear up some common misconceptions:

* No, Java was not made by or for Minecraft. Minecraft came into existence in 2010. Java has been around since 1996.
* No, you do not _have to_ pay Oracle if you use Java. You can download Java from other organizations
with non-litigious track records like [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) if you are nervous. 
* No, Java is not the same thing as JavaScript. JavaScript is a very different beast. The naming is very confusing yes. The [history is wild](https://javascript.tm/).


The drawing at the top is Java's official[^coffee] mascot.[^what] The [drawing below is JavaScript's](https://javascript-mascot.github.io/).

The differences between these mascots are representative of the differences between the two languages.



[^coffee]: There is another logo people use for Java - a coffee cup with steam coming off of it -
that is a trademarked symbol of Oracle. If you use it there is a high likelyhood of Oracle
juicero-ing your first-born.

[^what]: What is that mascot? Well it is named "Duke," but beyond that your guess is as good as mine.
I'll be using that ambiguity to its fullest.
