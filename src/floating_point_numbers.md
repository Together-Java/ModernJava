# Floating Point Numbers

Floating point numbers are used to represent numbers
which cannot be stored as Integers like `2.5` or `3.14`.

```java,no_run
double x = 1.5;
double y = 8.0;
double z = -3.14;
```

The type you will use to store a floating point number is `double`.
`double` stands for "double precision floating point."
