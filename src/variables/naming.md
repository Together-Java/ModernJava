# Naming

It is a social convention[^perry] that local variables be named `likeThis`.

That is if their name is one word, that word should be in lowercase.

```java
String apple = "Red Delicious";
```

If it is multiple words, the first word should be lowercase and the others should start with a capital letter.

This convention is called `camelCase` because the capitals looks like the humps on a Camels back[^camel].

Just like proper formatting, sticking to this style will increase your chances of someone online being able to
help you with your code.
