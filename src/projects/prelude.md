# Prelude

Separate from the challenges at the end of each section I will be putting some projects
sections throughout the book.

While the purpose of the challenges is to make you practice what you just read,
the purpose of the projects is for you to put that knowledge into action.

This is for two reasons

1. If you don't practice for real, it is very difficult to learn things.
2. I want to drive home that software is an interdisciplinary field.

The first reason means that, while be some early hand-holding, I largely expect
you to put together projects on your own using what you have been shown.
This means you will struggle. The hope is that in that struggle you are forced to learn,
but you can always ask for help.

By that second point I mean we make software to do things in the real world.
To do this requires understanding who would use the software, why, and for what purpose.
I am going to try my best to have projects that make you interact with the world outside
of software construction.
