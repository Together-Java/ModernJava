# Buy Now, Pay Later

## Problem Statement

People exchange money for goods and/or services.

Some of these purchases are non-essential. This means that they are,
strictly speaking, optional. Ordering extra guacamole at a restraunt,
buying a brand new pair of shoes, and buying a diamond ring are all
examples of non-essential spending.

Other purchases are essential. If you are having a heart attack (within
the United States) medical care is a mandatory expense. You either make that
purchase or you die. If one does not have some minimum level of food, water, and shelter
those are also essential expenses.

It comes down to needs and wants. If you need to have something that is an essential purchase.
If you want to have something that is a non-essential purchase.

Many people do not have enough money for their essential expenses.
This can be due to any number of reasons, but in the United States minimum wage has
not kept up with overall inflation since 1968. Add to that rising costs of housing,
transportation, education, etc. and people's financial

Some people have much more money than they could ever need. These people,
sometimes pooling funds via corporations, often choose to loan this money
to those that do not have enough for their expenses.

The reason they do this is because they can charge fees. If someone can't afford
a particular expense of ~$100 they can get the money for that expense right away in exchange for agreeing
to say a 2% interest rate. This would mean that the amount they owe goes up by 2% every month or so that they
do not pay the loan issuer back.

Banks work this way. You deposit money in the bank and, while the bank and the government
guarentee you that you can go at any time and get your money out, they are also turning around
and lending that money to any number of businesses and individuals.

So long as you assume most people will be able to eventually pay off their debts being a loan issuer
is a very profitable business to be in. It is also something of a public good.[^christmas] But if a large number of people are unable to pay off their debts
you can get financial collapses. This can be at the level of an indidual loan issuer or entire countries.

Because it is bad when this happens governments generally have laws that restrict the "level of risk"
loan issuers are allowed to take on. If they "take on too much risk" - meaning loan enough money
to people who aren't able to pay it back - there will eventually be a collapse.

The level of scrutiny that applies to normal debts does not seem to, at least in the United States,
apply when you do it via payment plans and call it "Buy Now, Pay Later." This allows for businesses
to make loans they otherwise wouldn't be allowed to to people that might not otherwise qualify.

This certainly helps people who are struggling to get enough to affort their essential expenses.
It can also help people make non-essential expenses which they deem essential. Human's are imperfect
creatures. Many will take on a payment plan with an interest rate for a burrito.

In all cases the ability to take on debt can either help someone stabilize their financial situation
or it can ultimately make things worse. The higher the interest rate the more likely the second situation
comes to pass.

In the modern world computers are required to track both the issuance of these debts as
well as compute interest and facilitate the collection process. This is in part because payments
are often made electronically but also in part because the overhead of paying a person
to manually keep track of all this info would eat in to the profits from interest and flat fees.

"Buy Now, Pay Later" programs also want to be embedded into online storefronts. People are much more likely
to accept higher interest rates or take on the debt at all the closer the offer is made to "the point of sale." This requires not only business deals but a non-trivial amount of code.

## Your Goal

Never make a program for this.

"Buy Now, Pay Later" is another word for debt. If you make a program that
enables desperate people go deeper and deeper into debt to enrich yourself
you are a scumbag.

I put this "project" here to tell you that building software is not
a neutral act. You need to critically consider how what you decide to spend
your time on will affect the world around you.

Facebook is one of the largest websites in the world. It makes a lot of
people a lot of money. The world would be a better place
if it did not exist.

There are real companies - at the time of writing the biggest one is called [Klarna](https://klarna.com/) -
which are more than happy to offer loans to the desperate and short-sighted. Their existence makes the
world a worse place and they could not exist without the efforts of people who write software.

## Future Goals

None.

money so they can buy a home to live in can be a great thing.
