# Reflection

Reflection is what we call it when a program
uses information about how it - the program - is structured
in order to do things while running.

We call it reflection because its as if your code
looks into a mirror and sees its own reflection.[^whenhumans]

[^whenhumans]: When a human looks into a mirror they might see their own eye color.
If a mirror weren't there it would be difficult to know such things.
