# String Literals

In order to write text in a program, you surround it with
double quotes.

```java
"Hello, World"
```

This is called a "string literal." It has the same relationship to `String`
that an integer literal like `123` has to `int`.

```java
// Same as this "integer literal" is used to write a number
int abc = 123;
// A "string literal" is used to write text
String name = "penelope";
```
