# Benefits of Java

Java has some key benefits that youâ€™ll need to know ðŸ˜‰.

## Object Oriented
Java is a popular programming language that is based on [the object-oriented programming (OOP)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP) paradigm. This means that Java code is defined in classes, which are like blueprints that describe the properties and behaviors of objects.

Compared to [procedural programming languages](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-procedural-and-object-oriented-programming) that use routines or methods without classes, Java's use of OOP allows for better code organization and reuse. However, Java also allows for [functional programming](#functional) within a class, which can make certain operations more concise and readable.

As you learn Java, it is important to understand the principles of object-oriented programming and how to use classes and objects effectively. Additionally, gaining familiarity with functional programming concepts can help you write more concise and efficient code in certain situations.

### Encapsulation
You can use access modifiers to control access to your class members (fields, methods, and nested classes). This is an important feature that allows you to protect your data from unintended access and modification.

## Functional
A way of writing code more **declaratively**. You specify what you want to do rather than dealing with the state of objects. You focus more on expressions
than loops. 

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions as the primary building blocks of a software. In Java, one of the key features of functional programming is the use of [lambda expressions](todo), which are anonymous functions that can be passed around as arguments to other functions or stored in variables. (You'll see more about these in [Lambda's](todo) chapter).

## Independent
Java is a compiled language that generates bytecode, which can be interpreted by the [Java Virtual Machine (JVM)](https://www.javatpoint.com/jvm-java-virtual-machine) on any platform . One of the benefits of this approach is that Java code only needs to be compiled once, and it can then run on any operating system that has a JVM installed. This concept is commonly referred to as ["write once, run everywhere."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere) ðŸ˜Ž

## Strong
Java has a significant advantage over some popular languages such as [C++](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/C) in terms of memory management. Unlike C++, Java manages memory on its own and automatically performs [garbage collection](). This feature makes Java more robust and helps prevent memory leaks that can lead to errors and program crashes in C++.

## Secured
Java code runs inside the JVM! This creates a sandbox that makes it harder for code to do malicious behaviors on the computer it's running on.
