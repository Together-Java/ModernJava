# Return

In addition to running some code, a method can return a value to the code that is calling it.

To do this, instead of writing `void` before a method, you should write the name of a type like `int`.
Then at the end of the method you need to write `return` followed by something which is that type.

```java
int returnsEight() {
    return 8;
}
```
