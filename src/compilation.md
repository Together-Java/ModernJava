# Compilation

The first step to sharing code you've written with other people is to
compile it.

Compilation in the context of programming languages means that a program
reads all your code, ensures it abides by the rules of the language,
and translates your code to some other form. Usually this other form 
is in some manner more directly "runnable" than the code you started with.

We call programs that do this reading, ensuring, and translation "compilers."

This happens behind the scenes when you run `java src/Main.java`
but for sharing code you will need to do it yourself as a separate
step.
