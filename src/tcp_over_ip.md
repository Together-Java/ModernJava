# TCP over IP

Most of the internet is built on top of something called "TCP over IP"
or "Transmission Control Protocol over Internet Protocol."

If those words don't make it immediately obvious what that means, thats normal.
The short version is that the "IP" part refers to how computers find eachother
on the internet and the "TCP" part refers to the how those computers
speak to eachother once they've found eachother.

For the long version, I'll defer to this youtube video.
