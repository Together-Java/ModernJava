## Challenge 1.

Make your own implementation of a growable array that holds `String`s and not
`int`s.

Validate that `.size`, `.add`, `.get`, `.set`, etc. all work as you would expect.

## Challenge 2.

Go back to your calorie tracker program from that project.
Make use of a growable array of some kind to keep the full history
of calorie amounts entered by the user.

## Challenge 3.

When implementing the point of sale system project you may or may not have
gone down the path of discovering growable arrays for yourself. Either way
refactor that project to make use of a growable array to store the items
ordered for the purpose of making a receipt.
