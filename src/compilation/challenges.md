- Try to use only the information given up to this point in this book.
- Try not to give up until you've given it a solid attempt

## Challenge 1.

Take your code from one of the previous projects and compile all of it
to class files.

Make sure you can then run it using those class files.

## Challenge 2.

Take the code for one of the previous projects and put it in
the multi-module directory layout.

Compile it using the `--module-source-path` and `--module`
options instead of listing the files out explicitly.

Make sure you can then run it using the `--module-path` and `--add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH`
flags.


## Challenge 3.

Run the command from the previous command again, this time making sure to pass `-g`.
Be sure to also clean whatever directory you used for output.
