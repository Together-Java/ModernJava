# Unboxing Conversion

If you try to use a boxed primitive in a context where
the normal type is expected, it will be implicitly "unboxed."

This means you can use `Integer`s directly in math expressions.

```java
~void main() {
Integer x = 5;
int y = 3;
int z = x * y;

System.out.println(z);
~}
```

As well as `Boolean`s in logical expressions.

```java
~void main() {
Boolean hasHat = true;
if (hasHat) {
    System.out.println("You have a hat!");
}
~}
```

And so on for `Double`, `Character`, etc.

But if you use one of these types like this and they happen to be `null` you will
get a `NullPointerException`.

```java,panics
~void main() {
Integer x = null;
// Bool
int y = x;
~}
```
