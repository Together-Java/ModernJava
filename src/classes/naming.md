# Naming

It is social convention to name classes with the first letter of each word capitalized. So if you wanted to
make a class representing an inch worm, you would say the following.[^fuzzy]

```java
class InchWorm {

}
```

[^fuzzy]: For things that are not English or are acronyms the rules get fuzzy. Use your best judgement.
