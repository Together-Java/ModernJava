# Operator Precedence

The operators that work on booleans have a "precedence order."

This is defines an order of operations similar to mathematics, where multiplication and division happen before
addition and subtraction.

For booleans `!` always happens first. This is followed by `&&` and then by `||`.

```java,no_run
boolean a = true;
boolean b = false;
boolean c = false;

// just as 2 + 5 * 3 "evaluates" 5 * 3 before adding 2
// first, !b is true
// second, a && true is true
// third true || c is true.
boolean result = a && !b || c;
```

Also like mathematics, parentheses can be used to control this order.

```java,no_run
// Even though || has a lower precedence than &&, we evaluate
// !b || c first because of the parentheses.
boolean result = a && (!b || c);
```
