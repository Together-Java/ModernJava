# Declaration

The simplest way to declare a method is to write `void` followed by some name, `()`, and some code inside of a `{` and `}`.

```java
void doThing() {
    System.out.println("Hello from inside a method!");
}
```

In this case, we declared a method named `doThing`. When it is run it will print out a message.
