# Strings

The `String` data type is used to represent text.

```java,no_run
String shortStory = "Everyone lived happily ever after, the end."
```

The word "string" comes from the fact that text is just individual characters "strung together".

As a concrete example `j`, `o`, and `e` can be "strung together" into the "string"
`joe`.
