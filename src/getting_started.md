# Getting Started

There are a lot of ways to "get set up" to run Java code.

For at least the first chunk of this, you should be able to get away with using
the editor on [https://run.mccue.dev](https://run.mccue.dev). That might be the easiest.

I will add tutorials here as they are requested or as I have time, but for the start
all that matters is that you have the ability to run and
edit the following code.

```java
void main() {
    System.out.println("Hello, World");
}
```

## Windows

Download the "JDK MSI" from [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=22&os=windows).

Run the installer, selecting all the default options.

## Mac OS



## repl.it

[replit.com](https://replit.com) is a pretty common choice for teachers because
they will be able to give you assignments and have you share back your results.
It is also a decent option if your school only provides you with Chromebooks
or similar.

It requires an internet connection and you will have to make an account, but
otherwise it is fairly convenient.

If you are in school and your teacher has helped you get set up in some other
way it is okay to skip this section and just do it the way you were shown.


### Step 1. Make an account

Go to [replit.com](https://replit.com) and find the "Sign Up" button.
Websites change every now and then so these screenshots might be out of date.

Click it and sign up for an account.

### Step 2. Create a Java REPL

Find the "Create REPL" button and click it.

Then you should be presented with a menu that lets you search for the type of REPL to create.
Find the Java template and click "Create".

### Step 3. Run code

You should land on a screen with a big green run button, an open file called
"Main.java", and a blank window labeled "console".

alt="Picture of an unran hello world program"

Click that run button, and you should see the text `Hello, world!` appear under the console window.
