# Getting Started

There are a lot of ways to "get set up" to run Java code.

For at least the first chunk of this, you should be able to get away with using
the editor on [https://run.mccue.dev](https://run.mccue.dev). That might be the easiest.

I will add tutorials here as they are requested or as I have time, but for the start
all that matters is that you have the ability to run and
edit the following code.

```java
void main() {
    IO.println("Hello, World");
}
```

## Windows

Download the "JDK MSI" from [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=22&os=windows).

Run the installer, selecting all the default options.

## Mac OS

Download the "JDK .pkg" from [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=22&os=mac).

Run the installer, selecting all the default options.


## Linux

Linux is a little annoying. If you are using it you are likely used to it
by now, but you can use [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=22&os=linux) like everyone else, but there is no universal installer there.

You can either download the `.tar.gz` file that matches your machine, extract it,
and add the `bin` folder to your `PATH`, or you can try to find an installer for your
specific linux distribution.
