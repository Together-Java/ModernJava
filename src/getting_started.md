# Getting Started

There are a lot of ways to "get set up" to run Java code. 



For the first chunk of this book it will only matter that you have the

For at least the first chunk of this, you should be able to get away with using

```java
void main() {
    IO.println("Hello, World");

```

## Windows

Download the "JDK MSI" from [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=25&os=windows).

Run the installer, selecting all the default options.

## Mac OS

Download the "JDK .pkg" from [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=25&os=mac).

Run the installer, selecting all the default options.


## Linux

by now, but you can use [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=25&os=linux) like everyone else, but there is no universal installer there.

You can either download the `.tar.gz` file that matches your machine, extract it,
and add the `bin` folder to your `PATH`, or you can try to find an installer for your
specific linux distribution.
