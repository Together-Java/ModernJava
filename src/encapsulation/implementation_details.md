# Implementation Details

Just as there is almost always more than one way 
to remove the epidermis of a feline,
there is often more than one way to implement
a program.

We call properties and choices made when writing a program
that are not related to what that program ultimitely needs
to do "implementation details."

As an example, imagine you are about to type
a query into Microsoft Bing.[^bingit] The website you go to
and the search box you see are intended parts of the program.
The fact that if you click search you will see results is also
just what the program needs to do.

But all the mechanics of *how* that query is answered are
implementation details. 

[^bingit]: You know, when you have a question and just have to "bing it?"
