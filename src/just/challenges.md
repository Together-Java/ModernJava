# Challenges

Remember the rules for this are

- Try to use only the information given up to this point in this book.
- Try not to give up until you've given it a solid attempt

## Challenge 1.

Make a Justfile with a recipe named `hello` that runs `echo "hello"`.

Test it by running `just hello`.

## Challenge 2.

Make a `run` recipe that launches one of your programs.

## Challenge 3.

Take the commands you used to compile one of your projects
and put them into a `Justfile`.

Ensure that `just compile` will compile your code and `just clean` will
delete any output directories.

## Challenge 4.

Expand the `Justfile` from the previous challenge to also package
your code into a JAR.

## Challenge 5.

Expand the `Justfile` from the previous challenge to compile
and package multiple modules, not just one.
